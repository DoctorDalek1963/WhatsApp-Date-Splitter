# WhatsApp-Date-Splitter
# [WIP]

 A program to split exported WhatsApp chats into months to allow for more convenient zip file sizes to be formatted.

 I have previously written a program to reformat exported WhatsApp chats into HTML files.
 This program is intended to split exported chats into zip files containing truncated text files and the associated attachments.
 This will make it easier for the formatter to produce smaller HTML files.

## Notices:
 Please make sure the working directory is set to `WhatsApp-Date-Splitter/venv`
